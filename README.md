# HelloWorld

This is a companion source code for the [A Series of Steps](https://qnoid.com/2019/05/07/A-series-of-steps.html#Introduction) post. It is bundled as a library (not an executable) using the Swift Package.

Start by looking at the `HelloWorldTests.swift` file which holds 3 different tests that show how the API is meant to be used.
You can run the tests using the `swift test` command.
